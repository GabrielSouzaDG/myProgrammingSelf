# myProgrammingSelf
This repository is nothing else than an archive with simple and easy to understand codes,
it is not expected to be of any real use except for showing off my improvements in my career as a programmer,
some codes may be kinda weird ass looking and if it happens, please let me know and help me improve,
I am always open for new opinions and ways of building my codes structure,
thats it for now, thank you for stopping by <3
