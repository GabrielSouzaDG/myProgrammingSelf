# myProgrammingSelf
This repository is nothing else than an archive with simple and easy to understand codes
It is not expected to be of any real use except for showing off my improvements in my career as a programmer
Some codes may be kinda weird ass looking and if it happens, please let me know and helpe me improve
I am always open for new opinions and ways of building my codes structure
thats it for now, thank you for stopping by <3
